# 📊 Power BI Project | Financial Adviser Performance & Profitability Dashboard

I've recently started my very first Power BI project, focused on improving management visibility and decision-making within a fictional financial planning business providing comprehensive financial and investment advice.


# 🔍 The problem
Senior management lacked a clear, consolidated view of adviser performance, profitability, and service delivery. Key metrics such as revenue, cost per advice, turnaround time, and advice mix were difficult to track consistently across time periods, limiting the ability to make timely, data-driven decisions.

# 🎯 The objective
To design a management-ready Power BI dashboard that enables:

* Adviser performance analysis (MoM / QoQ / YoY)

* Profitability insights (advice revenue vs adviser cost)

* Cost per advice and revenue per advice metrics

* Turnaround time and service efficiency monitoring

* Advice type mix and scalability analysis

# 🛠️ What I built

* A star-schema data model with Adviser, Client, and Date dimensions

* Rolling 12-month DAX measures for revenue, advice volume, cost allocation, and profitability

* Adviser-level unit economics (cost per advice)

* Executive and operational dashboard views

* Conditional formatting (RAG status) to highlight service delivery risks

# 📈 Outcomes & insights

* Clear identification of high- and low-performing advisers

* Improved visibility of low-margin, high-effort advice types

* Actionable insights to support resourcing, pricing, and capacity planning decisions

* A scalable reporting framework suitable for ongoing management use
